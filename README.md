# cloud-code-challenge
Messing around with a challenge I got via email,  this was done in around 6hrs of work: 

* **Terraform**, runs as intended, might need to change lines 40, 49 & 70 to make it work in any other region =! us-west-1
* **MySQL**, Schema was built, found it in several online tutorials including the official MySQL documentation ****
* **App**, This is actually my 1st attemp at builting an API, was a nice excercise however its not pulling the data from MySQL its hardcoded in the Json Itself 

As you can see its not perfect but Im pretty sure is enough to get a conversation going, challenge is vague in many ways and It can take up to 6 hours or 1 week, so Im calling it after 6hrs


## A) Create a public repo for this exercise
https://github.com/vazeri/cloud-code-challenge

## B) Write a script to deploy the Infrastructure as code 
This can be found here https://github.com/vazeri/cloud-code-challenge/tree/main/terraform

In order to run the terraform script AWS secrets have been setup as environment variables 
**Debian, Ubuntu**
```console
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

## C) Write a script to deploy the application
A rest API was generatrd to serve as an aplication endpoint, it was provided as a JSON file, 
https://github.com/vazeri/cloud-code-challenge/tree/main/API

This can be deployed using using the EC2 starting parameters, user thata on the instance launch i didnt actually went to finish this part but It would be something around this:

```console
if ${abortStartup}; then
    aws autoscaling complete-lifecycle-action --lifecycle-action-result ABANDON --instance-id ${INSTANCEID} --lifecycle-hook-name warmup --auto-scaling-group-name ${ASG} --region ${REGION}
else
    TESTING_PASSWORD=$(aws ssm get-parameter --with-decryption --name smoke_testing_pwd_${ENV} --region ${REGION} | jq -r ".Parameter.Value")
    x=1

    d=$(date)
    echo "${d}: Starting warm-up..."

    while [ $x -le 40 ]
    do
        web=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --connect-timeout 3 http://localhost:8080/version)
        pet=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --connect-timeout 3 -H "Authorization: Basic ${TESTING_PASSWORD}" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/pet)
        pets=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --connect-timeout 3 -H "Authorization: Basic ${TESTING_PASSWORD}" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/api/pets)

        d=$(date)
        echo "${d}: Web: ${web} - Pet: ${pet} - Pets: ${pets}"

        if [ ${Web} == "200" ] || [ ${pet} == "200" ] || [ ${pets} == "200" ] || [ ${web} == "200" ]; then
            sleep 5
            d=$(date)
            echo "${d}: Warmed up, putting instance into service"
            break
        else
            d=$(date)
            echo "${d}: API has not fully started, waiting 20 seconds before trying again..."
    
            sleep 20
            ((x++))
        fi
        
    done
```


## D) Security upgrades need to be performed every now and then 

This can be achieved by installing the AWS SSM agent in the image, this already comes prebuilt into the Ubuntu and AWS based Images, however a role might need to be added for it to work 

Since we are talking baout inmutable infrastructure here its recommended the agent is setup to run updates weeklty via de SSM Console 



# Extra points

## 1) How would you expose your app to the internet 

DNS record pointing to a Loadbalancer in a public subnet, that can re route the trafic to the private subnets 

## 2) What would you use to dynamacaly scale your application

Load balancers for both EC2 instances that have the App and migrate the database to an Aurora Database isntead of a simple RDS database 

During the development several alternatives where used to test the Mysql Queris in botu aurora and aurora severless leaving th ecoe here for future works 

```console
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "default" {
  cluster_identifier      = "code-challenge-aurora-cluster"
  engine                  = "aurora-mysql"
  engine_version          = "5.7.mysql_aurora.2.03.2"
  availability_zones      = ["us-west-1b", "us-west-1c"]
  database_name           = "mydb"
  master_username         = "foo"
  master_password         = "bar12345678"
  backup_retention_period = 5
  preferred_backup_window = "07:00-09:00"
  db_subnet_group_name    = "code-challenge-subnet-group"
}
```

## 3) How would you grant access to a developer to the database 

Create a pipeline of environments, DEV -> UAT -> PROD, Grant developers full access to DEV and UAT, and provide them tools to restore production snapshots to the DEV & UAT environments in case the screw something up by mistake 

## 4) Build v2 of the application 

Would love to but v1 wasnt even finished and its time for dinner, family requires attention too!
